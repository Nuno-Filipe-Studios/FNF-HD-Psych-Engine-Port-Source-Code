# Friday Night Funkin' HD - Psych Engine Port
Welcome to FNF HD psych engine port, this port was made for having a better experience playing FNF HD, in this port there's new options, new art and more! Remember i'm not the owner of FNF HD, FNF HD is made by Kolsan and the HD team, full credits to them and their hard work.

### FLA files are here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TZGM2CCRo3AFPW8rAEpJezPFVj9P52I5?usp=share_link

## Installation:
You must have Haxe 4.2.5 (https://haxe.org/download/version/4.2.5/).

Follow a Friday Night Funkin' Psych Engine source code compilation tutorial, after this you will need to install LuaJIT.

To install LuaJIT do this: `haxelib git linc_luajit https://github.com/nebulazorua/linc_luajit` on a Command prompt/PowerShell

...Or if you don't want your mod to be able to run .lua scripts, delete the "LUA_ALLOWED" line on Project.xml


If you get an error about StatePointer when using Lua, run `haxelib remove linc_luajit` into Command Prompt/PowerShell, then re-install linc_luajit.

If you want video support on your mod, simply do `haxelib install hxCodec` on a Command prompt/PowerShell

otherwise, you can delete the "VIDEOS_ALLOWED" Line on Project.xml
